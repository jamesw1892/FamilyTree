# Family Tree

A program for viewing and editing family members and a family tree.

# Purpose

- To record data about family members in one place including notes which can detail key points of their lives
- To help with remembering birthdays by providing a view sorted by closest birthday first, showing: name, number of days until birthday, birth day, and age on birthday
- To display a family tree dynamically made from the people

# Old Versions

There are 2 old versions:

- A very old version in Python that only runs locally
- A less old version in Java that has a command-line interface and web server. I tried getting it to work on an existing web server but this would not work very well dynamically without a library - the purpose of the new version
