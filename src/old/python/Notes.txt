Want to use validation to store the types everything should be so I can automatically read them in that way and use it to validate user input

What I want:

I/O:
Later, add an option to find and change specific bit every time we make a change
Later, record each change we make and at the end, save change we've made by finding and changing them individually in the file

TODO:
Use validation to check exact form of inputs


Ideally, make some automated way to set out how you want data to be stored and displayed and inputted 

Can use for contacts too if make general enough
For any CSV file, I want to be given a list of details of the data and for it to convert it into that data
